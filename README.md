# **DeepIntel AI** ðŸš€  
An advanced AI-driven research assistant powered by CrewAI, integrating Gemini and Groq for efficient information gathering, analysis, and content synthesis.  

## **Overview**  
**DeepIntel AI** is a multi-agent research system designed to:  
1. **Gather information** from various sources (**Researcher - Gemini**)  
2. **Analyze and process data** for insights (**Analyst - Groq**)  
3. **Synthesize refined content** for final output (**Writer - Gemini**)   

## **Tech Stack**  
- **CrewAI** â€“ Multi-agent orchestration  
- **Gemini** â€“ Large token window for research & synthesis  
- **Groq** â€“ High-speed analysis with DeepSeek 

## **Installation**  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## **Usage**  
```python  
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task  
from my_agents import researcher, analyst, writer  # Define your agents  

crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, analyst, writer])  
result = crew.kickoff()  
print(result)  
```

## **Why DeepIntel Agent?**  
âœ” **Fast & Efficient** â€“ Groq speeds up analysis.  
âœ” **Deep Research** â€“ Gemini processes large documents and ensures accuracy.  
âœ” **Structured Output** â€“ Ensures high-quality content generation.
